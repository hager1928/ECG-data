DSP(digital signal processing) (3th year 2022/2023)

MATLAB script that display a button this button is used to allow the user to select an ecg_data.mat file, then calculate the heart rate from this file. 
The required task:

➢ Create Graphical User Interface (GUI) for your task.
➢ Display the button to get the ecg_data.mat ➢ Plot the ecg data and display it. 
➢ Calculate the heart rate and display it. 
➢ Detect any myocardial dysfunction (just one is enough)
 
Note:- 
 
Heartbeat Rate in (beats/seconds) can be calculated by the formula: 
 
Rate = 60 * sampling rate / (R-R interval);
